## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

    At large scale investment management firms, transactional data flows through many different systems supported by different teams. Many large-scale asset management firms will opt to outsource middle and back office services due to the human capital and system costs required to support these functions. What Enfusion does is streamline the data transfer process from trade execution to settlement. They do offer a middle/back office outsourced service as well. Their service leverages the same platform. Enfusion will also provide KPI’s surrounding inefficiency and in data flow as well as robust reporting for investment managers.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

    The intended customers for Enfusion are emerging hedge funds, established hedge funds, asset management firms, and family offices. Enfusion has a flexible platform for each market size of customers. This company offers a single platform that will support from execution of trades to settlement, reconciliation, and accounting. Most providers in this space will offer either front office services or middle office and/or back office services. All these departments usually have different software with different requirements and limitations. The advantage to having a uniform platform throughout is the stability of data transfer and the ability to remove the need to build in house systems and processes to compensate for the gaps. 


* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

    Financial services technology

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

    Over the past 5 to 10 years asset management firms have been opting to outsource support roles/technologies due to cost. As this trend continues to become more popular, the technology demand in this space has become a struggle of scalability vs. customizability. Most of the major players in this space were large institutions such as JPMorgan, State Street and Northern Trust. As Fintech firms grow in this space, they have become more efficient at being able to build the technology needed to support scalability and customizability due to their resources and custom from scratch platforms. 

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

    Charles River, MSCI, Factset, Hedgeguard, BlackRock (Aladdin), Bloomberg,

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

    The metrics used to measure success in this space are revenue generation and service. As they are a private company their revenue is not publicly published. However, winning the award for best service provider in Europe for 2020, while going up against the larger providers is significant. There year over year global client onboarding numbers are incredibly positive as well.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

    Enfusion has taken steps to be a global provider in this space over the last few years. From May 2019 to May 2020 they onboarded 132 new clients globally and currently support over 4000 funds. As there are many players in this space, most do not support as a full end to end platform and are not cloud based. They either support middle and back office or front office not both. This allows them to efectively disrupt the market as we transform to a more digital and streamlined environment.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company? What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

    The only product or service that I would suggest is operating as a custodian for funds/safekeeping of securities. This will allow them to directly compete with some of the larger and more established firms as most that offer middle and back office services also act as custodian. I would try to implement this by targeting small to mid-size funds and offering it as a cheaper more streamlined alternative to the bigger firms and cause further disruption in the market. Much of the current infrastructure in place can be leveraged to help build out what is needed. As a fintech firm they will be able to improve the technology in the custodian space at a much more rapid pace.
